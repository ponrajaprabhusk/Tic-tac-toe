# Tic-tac-toe
My first Project which is a simple two-player game named tic-tac-toe.
# About the Game:
Tic Tac Toe  (also called Noughts and crosses, Xs and Os, XOXGame, 3 in a row) is a very popular pencil and paper board game.
It has very simple rules that is Two players can play with each other by using a 3×3 board in Tic Tac Toe. 
One player chooses noughts or zeroes, the opposing player uses crosses .
The first player to align 3 of their identical symbols, either noughts or crosses, (horizontally, vertically or diagonally) wins the game.
